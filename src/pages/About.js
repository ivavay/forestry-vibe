        I was born in Germany, raised in Toronto / Taipei / SF Bay and am
        currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I love to spend my time
        tinkering with technoglogy and art and am passionate about the educational
        side of this intersection. I also love to play tennis in my free time!
